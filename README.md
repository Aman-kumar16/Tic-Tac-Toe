# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is simple tic tac toe program in c++ which can be understood by the begineers also.
I have used numbers position same as numpad provided in keyboard to play the game.
It gives an option to the user1 to choose the symbol between "x" and "O".
user 2 will be assigned the other symbol automatically.
It shows a board with numbers printed on it you can press any number from your keyboard and that place will be filled by your respected symbol.
As soon as any of the two symbols occuy three consecutive positions either in any row,column or diagonally the program stops and declare the winner.
If user enter any number which is already entered it prints msg to indicate this and gives him again a chance to enter another position number.
As soon as 9 different positions entered the program stops and prints msg that game is draw.

Hope this helps!!
